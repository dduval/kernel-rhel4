Introduction
------------

The aic94xx driver supports Adaptec SAS/SATA Host Adapters
with AIC-94xx chips.  Features include 32/64 bit PCI/PCI-X
interface supporting up to 66 MHz PCI 2.3 and up to 133 MHz
PCI-X 2.0 operation.  It supports MSI or PCI interrupt pin.
      * AIC-9405W is a  4 phy host adapter, 4 port maximum.
      * AIC-9410W is an 8 phy host adapter, 8 port maximum.

The driver supports Revision B0 or later of the controller.


Hot plugging
------------

Hot plugging is supported, it works and has been tested.


Dynamic PCI IDs
---------------

To make the driver probe and attach to a new device it
doesn't quite recognize, you can dynamically add to the PCI
ID table of the driver as follows:

echo "vendor device" > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/aic94xx/new_id

For the complete details see Documentation/pci.txt file.


Not a HostRAID driver
---------------------

This driver is _not_ a HostRAID driver, it does _not_
provide RAID capabilities.  Although RAID could be built on
top of the devices exported by this driver.

If you would like this driver to attach to a HostRAID
enabled controller*, set the "attach_HostRAID" module
parameter to "1" either at module load time or through sysfs.

Kernel command line; append this:

       aic94xx.attach_HostRAID=1

Module loading, append this to your modprobe/insmod:

       attach_HostRAID=1

Or through sysfs, if the driver has already been loaded:

echo "1" > /sys/module/aic94xx/parameters/attach_HostRAID

* This of course could COMPLETELY destroy your HostRAID
  array, and is NOT recommended.
