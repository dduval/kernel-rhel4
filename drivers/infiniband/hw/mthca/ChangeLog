0.01: 17 May 2004:
	- Initial release.

0.02: 21 May 2004:
	- Change SSE2 doorbell implementation to plain SSE.
	- Add support for RC to QP modify (still can't post
	  atomic or RDMA ops).
	- Handle error CQ entries.
	- Fix CQN in SW2HW_CQ/HW2SW_CQ.
	- Various code cleanups.

0.03:  1 Jun 2004:
	- Allocate UD address vectors in HCA memory.
        - Add support for event-driven firmware commands.
        - Add "CQ cleaning": remove stale events when a QP is
	  destroyed.

0.04: 13 Jun 2004:
	- Fix endianness problems; now tested and working on
	  i386, ia64 and ppc64.
	- Fix alignment of eqe entry types by using
	  __attribute__((packed)) properly.
	- Make MTT writes even length for FW efficiency.
	- Add wmb() after writing "next" segment for sends and
	  receives to ensure descriptor is fully written before
	  doorbell is rung.
	- Make sure send_wqe_offset is aligned to size of send
	  WQEs to prevent WQEs from crossing a page boundary.

0.05:  8 Nov 2004:
	- Set local ACK timeout and retry count values
	  correctly in QP modify.
	- Set PCI-X Read Byte Count and PCI Express Max Read
	  Request Size register for max performance.
	- Implement new "poll multi" operation.
	- Fix allocation of direct QPs and CQs on platforms
	  where pci_alloc_consistent() may return a DMA address
	  not aligned to the size of the buffer (eg IBM
	  pSeries).
	- Implement MSI/MSI-X support.  (MSI-X support requires
	  HCA firmware that has not been released yet.  Both
	  MSI and MSI-X may be less stable than using standard
	  INTx).
	- Implement more asynchronous events.
	- Always reset the HCA on initialization since we we
	  might not be able to tell that the HCA was left
	  running.
	- Remove mthca_pci.h (since we already depend on kernel
	  2.6.8). 
	- Rework API to conform with new OpenIB verbs.
	- Fix mapping of HCA memory on JS20 (don't trust what the HCA
	  tells us about PCI addresses).
        - Don't request SRQ events if FW doesn't support SRQ.
        - Add firmware version and revision ID to sysfs.
        - Add get_dma_mr entry point.

0.06: in progress:
	- Processed trap repress packets should be consumed.
	- Replace writel(swab32(x)) with __raw_writel(x) (and
	  similarly for writeq) now that ppc64 EEH is fixed.
	- Add Arbel workaround when creating AVs without GRH.
	- Add support for querying link speed/width.
	- Add an rmb() between checking the ownership bit of an event
	  queue entry and reading the contents of the EQE (ppc64 fix).
	- Implement port_modify with SET_IB.
        - Start on Arbel Mem-Free support.
        - Reduce data path locking (patches from MST).
