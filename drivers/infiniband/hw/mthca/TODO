Small projects (extensions to existing code):
    Full support for asynchronous events: dispatching various
        unaffiliated errors still needs to be implemented.
    UD address vectors in HCA memory with DDR hidden: Even if the HCA
        does not expose its memory via a PCI BAR, the ACCESS_DDR
        firmware command could be used to write UD address vectors
        into HCA memory.
    Miscellaneous verbs: At least query AH, query QP and query SRQ are
        not implemented.
    Reduce doorbell locking on 32-bit architectures: By using a
        a doorbell page dedicated to each EQ, no lock is required in
        the EQ poll path.
    Finish SRQ support: add support for resizing SRQs.

Medium projects (well understood but require a fair amount of code):
    SMR support: ib_mthca does not support shared memory regions.
    MW support: ib_mthca does not support memory windows.
