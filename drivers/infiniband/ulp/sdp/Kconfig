config INFINIBAND_SDP
	tristate "Sockets Direct Protocol"
	depends on INFINIBAND && INFINIBAND_IPOIB
	---help---
	  Support for Sockets Direct Protocol (SDP).  This provides
          sockets semantics over InfiniBand via address family
          AF_INET_SDP (address family 26).  You can also LD_PRELOAD the
          libsdp library from <http://openib.org> to have standard
          sockets applications use SDP.

config INFINIBAND_SDP_DEBUG
	bool "Sockets Direct Protocol debugging"
	depends on INFINIBAND_SDP
	---help---
	  This option causes debugging code to be compiled into the
	  SDP driver.  The output can be controlled via the debug_level
	  module parameter.

config INFINIBAND_SDP_DEBUG_DATA
	bool "Sockets Direct Protocol data path debugging"
	depends on INFINIBAND_SDP_DEBUG
	---help---
	  This option causes debugging code in the data path to be
          compiled into the SDP driver, and will noticeably effect
          performance. The output can be controlled via the debug_level
	  module parameter.
